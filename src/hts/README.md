# HTS

HTS is suuplied as a patch on top of HTK.  To download HTK, an account is
necessary; for this reason the download is manual.

To get HTK, go to
[http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/download.shtml](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/download.shtml)
and login.  Then the browser should allow these two downloads:

[http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/ftp/software/HTK-3.4.1.tar.gz](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/ftp/software/HTK-3.4.1.tar.gz)

[http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/ftp/software/hdecode/HDecode-3.4.1.tar.gz](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/ftp/software/hdecode/HDecode-3.4.1.tar.gz)

Put the resulting files in `buslr/hts` and then `make hts` should work.
